      Hi! Our names are Reagan, Wesley, and Kyle and we're the developers behind this website. We're all college students that attend UW and major in some sort of STEM field. All of us have been gaming since we were kids and have always been interested in things like building PCs, programming, and game development.
      Over the years, we've had experiece growing up playing a variety of games and game genres which has inspired us to make this website.
      Even though we developed this website as a project for Bay Area Hacks 2023, we hope it continues to serve as a fun little place that comes up when you think about activities to do with friends, on stream, or something to kill 5 (or more) minutes of your time when you're bored.

        <p class="mt-4">I grew up playing a lot of games (probably more than I should have) and evetually made my way down the "become a game developer" pipeline. I currently study Computer Science and Software Engineering at UW and plan to graduate 2024 Spring. The games I primarily play are League of Legends (Diamond Support Main), Valorant (Gold Viper OTP),
          TFT (Plat in Double Up), and BTD6 (Veteran Level 4 Ben Jammin Enthusiast).

        <p>For me, I've always been a personal fan of single player games. Most of the time I find to play, I find that games like Super Auto Pets, Hearts of Iron IV, and Pokemon are my go-to defaults. That said, every once and a while I'll boot up League of Legends and carry the guy above me to scratch that competitive itch I get once in a while.
