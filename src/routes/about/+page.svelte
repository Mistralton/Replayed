			Hi! Our names are Reagan, Wesley, and Kyle and we're the developers behind this website. We're
			all college students that attend UW and major in some sort of STEM field. All of us have been
			gaming since we were kids and have always been interested in things like building PCs,
			programming, and game development. Over the years, we've had experiece growing up playing a
			variety of games and game genres which has inspired us to make this website. Even though we
			developed this website as a project for Bay Area Hacks 2023, we hope it continues to serve as
			a fun little place that comes up when you think about activities to do with friends, on
			stream, or something to kill 5 (or more) minutes of your time when you're bored.

					I grew up playing a lot of games (probably more than I should have) and evetually made my
					way down the "become a game developer" pipeline. I currently study Computer Science and
					Software Engineering at UW and plan to graduate 2024 Spring. The games I primarily play
					are League of Legends (Diamond Support Main), Valorant (Gold Viper OTP), TFT (Plat in
					Double Up), and BTD6 (Veteran Level 4 Ben Jammin Enthusiast).

					I played a lot of games growing up, including League of Legends for most of my life.
					Nowadays, I rarely play League, and have gravitated towards expanding my repertoire,
					playing a variety of games (mostly RPGs) that I was unable to play while being addicted to
					League. Some of the games I still play are League of Legends (Gwen), Starcraft 2 (co-op),
					Super Auto Pets, Skyrim, and others.
