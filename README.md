## What it does
Replayed is a website that allows users to guess the competitive ladder rank of user submitted clips for games they see on their feed. Once they guess, they are told if they guessed correctly and are shown statistics about the distribution of guesses from other users. They are also able to comment and share their thoughts in a comment section specific to the clip they just rated. Additionally, they can upload their own clips to be rated by other users.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## To Implement when more time
Streaks for more gamification

Able to interact with other user profiles

Location.reload on the traditional route needs to be changed

Handle Zod error uniquely.

Looking forward, we are hoping to support more games, improve our UI design, UX experience, and grow our user-base community.
